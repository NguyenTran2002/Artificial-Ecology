    <h1>Artificial Ecology of Four Species by Nguyen Tran</h1>
    
      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

        <h3>
          This website demonstrates a sustainable artificial ecology between four species:
          Plant, Herbivore, Carnivore, and Intelligent Omnivore.<br>They are interacting in a complete system.
          They die when there is not enough food. Herbivores consume plants, plants get energy from<br>photosynthesis, 
          carnivores consume herbivores (and Intelligent Omnivores), and Intelligent Omnivores consume any species they come across.<br>
          They reproduce when gathered enough resources. They die when consumed by another species.<br><br>
          
          As time progresses, the initial state of the grid will turn into a stable ecology.<br>At this point, the
          number of plants almost does no change, the numbers of herbivores and carnivores are roughly equal, and<br>
          the number of Intelligent Omnivores can be dominating.<br><br>
            
          Within the grid, plants are represented as green squares, herbivores as blue squares, carnivores as red squares, and<br>
          Intelligent Omnivores as yellow squares.
